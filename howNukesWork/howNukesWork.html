    <h1>How Nukes Work</h1>
    <h3>How Nukes Work In General</h3>
    <p>Most nuclear weapons derive their energy and power from nuclear fission. Weapons harnessing fusion are called h-bombs (hydrogen bombs) and weapons harnessing fission are called a-bombs (atomic bombs). However, in most nuclear bombs today, engineers combine chemical explosives, nuclear fission, and nuclear fusion to create explosives many thousands times more powerful than back in the 1940s. Nuclear bombs work by having the chemical explosives compress nuclear material. This compression results in nuclear fission, which produces massive amounts of energy. This high amount of energy increases the temperature greatly, which leads to fusion. The combination of fission and fusion creates an even more powerful nuclear bomb which is capable of creating massive amounts of destruction. Only 6 countries in the world have conducted nuclear testing, India, the UK, the US, Russia, China, and France. </p>

    <h3>Other Types Of Nuclear Bombs</h3>  
    <p>However, there are still several other types of nuclear bombs. For example, boosted fission bombs increase the fission explosion through a few fusion reactions. Even though there are fusion reactions, the major explosion of the bomb still comes from fission. There are two different types of boosted fission weapons, one that is internally boosted, and one that is externally boosted. The internally boosted fission bombs have lithium-deuteride injected into the center of the bomb. The externally boosted bomb has a shell of lithium-deuteride with depleted uranium layering the core of the bomb. These different weapon designs allowed the Soviet Union to create their first partially nuclear weapons, but now, these weapons are useless, compared to the size of modern day nukes.</p>
