    <h1>Background Info</h1>
    <h3>How It All Started</h3>
    <p>The nuclear bomb was created during WW2 to rapidly take out the Japanese. The United States did not want to fight a war of attrition, so they developed a strategy to quickly eliminate the opposition. Known as the Manhattan Project, this was the project that was responsible for creating one of the most powerful weapons of mass destruction known to humanity. The Manhattan Project was started in 1939, and was kept so secretive that some of the members didn't even know what they were building until the bomb was already made. The project was lead by Robert Opennheimer, an extremely smart American theoretical physicist. He, along with many other famous scientists from not only America, but all over the world would meet a different sites to conduct the building of the first nuclear bomb. The three main sites of construction and expiremnt were Los Alamos, Richland, and Oak Ridge, all converted to military labatories for the special purpose of creating the nuclear bomb. After six years of hard labor, thousands upon thousands of man hours, and tens of failed experiments, the nuclear bomb was finally created. The power of the bomb was estimated to be over 20 kilotons of TNT and the test of it permanently left a crater Jornada del Muerto desert. The first nuclear bomb used for war purposes was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 and completely obliterated the city. The second was dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945 leading to the surrender of the Japanese. To this day, no other nuclear bombs have been dropped on another country with the intent to harm other people. The nuclear bomb has since been banned by Geneva and is considered a weapon of mass destruction that should not be used at all costs. </p>

    <h3>Nuclear Bombs Now</h3>  
    <p>Nuclear bombs now have been mass produced by countries like the Russia, the U.S., the U.K, France, China, and many more. Nuclear bombs have been improved greatly since the 1940s being over 20 times stronger than they were when they first dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Many projects such as Operation Ivy (A series of 8 thermonuclear tests), Project 57, and Julin were initiated with the soul purpose of making stronger bombs. Nuclear bomb testing has been banned all over the world to protect the wellbeing of civilians. However, with nuclear power plant accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi, the fate of the entire world is still at risk. Members of organizations and companies running factories with nuclear substances in it have to take extra precautions. The technology brought with nuclear bombs has really had a profound impact on our world but someday, it might negatively impact us with a much greater magnitude. </p>
    <p>There are only nine countries with nuclear bombs. They are: Russia, The United States of America, India, Pakistan, North Korea, China, France, The United Kingdom, and Israel.</p>
