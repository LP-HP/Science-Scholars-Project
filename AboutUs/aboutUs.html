    <h3>Kevin Zhang</h3>
    <p>Kevin Zhang also is in the 7th grade of Davis Drive Middle School. He is the smartest of the group, being far more intellectually gifted than everybody else. If he can, Kevin studies math 25/8. He enjoys doing math and is much better than Harshil Pande at Fortnite. He also has no appendix as it had gotten inflamed and removed. Now his friends and groupmembers ridicule him for having no appendix. "What appendix Kevin?" (Kevin is fine with this).</p>
