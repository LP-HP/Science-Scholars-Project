    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h3>Harshil Pande</h3>
    <p>Harshil Pande is an aspiring coder who enjoys spending his free time coding. He is a crazy coder. Harshil Pande is in the 7th grade and attends Davis Drive Middle School. When he grows up, he would like to focus on computer science and become a software engineer and is also claims to be infinitely better than Kevin at Fortnite, but there is currently a dispute between Kevin Zhang and Harshil Pande about who is better at Fortnite.</p>

    <h3>Tiger Zhao</h3>
    <p>Like Harshil Pande, Tiger Zhao is in the 7th grade and attends Davis Drive Middle School. He enjoys doing Khan Academy in his free time. His favorite subject is science and has spent hours upon hours studying it. He likes to sweat Khan Academy constantly because he doesn't like touching grass. Also Tiger like making stuid jokes about math and science, as well as dad jokes. Tiger claims to be a griddy tikka monster, but we have no evidence, nor proof to confirm this claim, so as of now, Tiger's claim of being a griddy tikka monster is not real and he is human.</p>

    <h3>Neveel Chheda</h3>
    <p>Along with Tiger Zhao and Harshil Pande, Neveel Chheda is in the 7th grade of Davis Drive Middle School. He likes math and science, but hates ELA with a passion. To him, social studies are fine, only if the information is interesting, such as World War II. He especially likes wasting his life playing Minecraft and Valorant. He can solve Rubik's Cubes really fast, as his time for the 3x3 cube is only 9 seconds and 49 miliseconds. He is the first ever dinga male and hopes that in the future there will be a lot more of his kind.</p>

    <h3>Kevin Zhang</h3>
    <p>Kevin Zhang also is in the 7th grade of Davis Drive Middle School. He is the smartest of the group, being far more intellectually gifted than everybody else. If he can, Kevin studies math 25/8. He enjoys doing math and is much better than Harshil Pande at Fortnite. He also has no appendix as it had gotten inflamed and removed. Now his friends and groupmembers ridicule him for having no appendix. "What appendix Kevin?" (Kevin is fine with this).</p>
